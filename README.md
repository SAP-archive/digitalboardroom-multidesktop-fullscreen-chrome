# Multi Desktop Fullscreen for Chrome #

Multi Desktop Full Screen for Chrome shows a web page extended across one or more desktops without a menu bar, toolbar or title bar. Without this app, Google Chrome can only use full screen on a single desktop monitor.

With this Chrome App we can use Windows 10 to extend the desktop (which is a standard way of doing things and does not require specific graphics cards) instead of using the graphics cards to make a combined desktop.

## Setup Instructions ##

2. *Note: If you need to you can rearrange the display order so that when you select identify then match the order shown  under Customize your displays (1 - 2  - 3, or 2 - 1 - 3, etc)*
3. Make your **left-most display** the **main display** (primary)

### Use Windows 10 Tablet PC Settings for touch ###
